# Rust + FasterWhisper Transcription App

A blazing-fast Rust application that leverages Python's `faster-whisper` library for audio transcription with Apple Metal GPU acceleration. This application **defaults to the medium model** for optimal balance between speed and accuracy, with **significant performance gains** on Apple Silicon Macs.

## üöÄ Why Medium Model? (Reality Check)

Our benchmarks show that the **medium model** provides **significantly better accuracy** but comes with **major performance trade-offs on Intel Macs**:

- **Superior Accuracy**: Correctly transcribes "rare dish" vs base model's "reddish" error
- **Intel Mac Performance**: 0.77x real-time factor (slower than listening!)
- **Better Segmentation**: 10 segments vs 8 (base model)
- **Higher Confidence**: 99.53% vs 99.16% language detection

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Medium model is **6x slower than base model** on Intel Macs but provides much better accuracy.

### Performance Reality Check

| Configuration | Real-time Factor | Quality Score | Best For |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Tiny** | **6.46x** | Good | **Speed priority** |
| **Base** | **4.47x** | Good | **Balanced choice** |
| **Medium** | **0.77x** | **Excellent** | **Accuracy priority only** |

*All results from actual testing on MacBook Pro 16-inch 2019 (Intel i7)*

## üîß Development

### Running with Logs

```bash
export PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3.11
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- -i audio.wav
```

### Building for Different Targets

```bash
# Set Python environment first
export PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3.11

# macOS Apple Silicon (optimized)
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin

# macOS Intel
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin

# Linux (requires Python 3.11+ on target system)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Python Environment Issues

The most common issue is PyO3 not finding the correct Python installation:

```bash
# Method 1: Use system Python
export PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
cargo build --release

# Method 2: Use Homebrew Python (recommended)
brew install python@3.11
export PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3.11
cargo build --release

# Method 3: Find your Python installation
which python3
export PYO3_PYTHON=$(which python3)
cargo build --release

# Verify faster-whisper is installed
python3 -c "import faster_whisper; print('‚úì faster-whisper available')"
```

### Build Issues

```bash
# Clean and rebuild if you encounter linking errors
cargo clean
export PYO3_PYTHON=$(which python3)
cargo build --release

# If you get "library 'python3.x' not found":
# Make sure you have Python development headers installed
# On macOS: This is usually included with Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

### Metal/GPU Issues

```bash
# Check Metal availability on macOS using Python 3.11
/usr/local/bin/python3.11 -c "import torch; print('MPS available:', torch.backends.mps.is_available())"

# Force CPU if Metal causes issues
export PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3.11
cargo run --release -- -i audio.wav -d cpu
```

### PyO3 Linking Issues

If you encounter linking errors during build:

```bash
# Method 1: Use Homebrew Python (recommended)
brew install python@3.11
export PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3.11

# Method 2: If still having issues, try system Python
export PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3

# Method 3: Use conda/miniconda Python
# conda install python=3.11
# export PYO3_PYTHON=$(conda info --base)/bin/python

# Clean and rebuild after setting Python path
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

### Common Runtime Issues

```bash
# Error: "Input path does not exist" with spaces in filename
# WRONG: cargo run --release -- -i /path/Trial wav.m4a
# CORRECT: Use quotes around the filename
cargo run --release -- -i "/path/Trial wav.m4a"

# Error: Python library not found at runtime
# Make sure to set PYO3_PYTHON before running
export PYO3_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3.11
cargo run --release -- -i "your_audio.m4a"
```

### Performance Issues

1. **Use appropriate model size** for your hardware
2. **Enable Metal** with `-d mps` on Apple Silicon
3. **Use float16** for best speed/accuracy balance
4. **Close other GPU-intensive applications**
