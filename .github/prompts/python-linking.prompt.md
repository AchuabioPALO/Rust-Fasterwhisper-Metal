# Rust Application Linking Python

You're getting this error:

```
ld: library not found for -lpython3.9
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1
```

This is a **common linking issue** when using `pyo3` and Rust ‚Äî your build is trying to link to **Python 3.9**, but you don‚Äôt have that version installed in the expected location.

---

## ‚úÖ The Problem

Your `cargo build` is looking for:

```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.9
```

But your actual Python version is likely different (e.g., 3.11 via Homebrew).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The Fix: Tell Cargo Where Your Real Python Is

### 1. First, check what Python you‚Äôre using:

```bash
which python3
python3 --version
```

Let‚Äôs say the output is:

```
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
Python 3.11.3
```

Good ‚Äî now we tell `pyo3` to use **that Python**, not the broken Xcode one.

---

### 2. Set the `PYTHON_SYS_EXECUTABLE` environment variable

You have two ways to do it:

#### Option A: For just one build

```bash
PYTHON_SYS_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3) cargo build --release
```

#### Option B: Add it to your shell config (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.)

```bash
export PYTHON_SYS_EXECUTABLE=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
```

Then:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or whatever shell you use
cargo build --release
```

---

### 3. Optional: Clean old broken builds

```bash
cargo clean
```

---

### üß™ Bonus: Make sure Python has headers installed

Run this:

```bash
python3 -m pip install maturin
```

And make sure the following works:

```bash
python3 -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_config_var('LIBDIR'))"
```

---

## ‚úÖ After this, `cargo build` should link successfully.

Want me to generate a `.env` file or script that auto-sets the correct Python config for builds?
