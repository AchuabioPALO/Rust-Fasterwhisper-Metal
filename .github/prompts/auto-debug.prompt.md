Expected output and any relevant constraints for this task.
automatically debug the Rust application that uses the `faster-whisper` library to transcribe audio files. The application should be optimized for performance, especially on macOS with Metal acceleration.
The application should handle various audio formats, provide accurate transcriptions, and be able to run on macOS and Linux. It should also be able to handle multiple audio files concurrently and provide detailed error messages in case of failures. The application should follow Rust's best practices and idioms, and be well-documented and easy to use.
