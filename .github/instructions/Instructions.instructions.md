Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

we are building a Rust application that uses the `faster-whisper` library to transcribe audio files. The application should be able to handle various audio formats and provide accurate transcriptions.
-we want to run it on mac's "metal" which is a GPU
- we want to use the latest version of the `faster-whisper` library
- the idea is that running a rust + fasterwhisper app on metal would lead to crazy speed gains?
# The application should be efficient and optimized for performance.
- The application should be able to handle large audio files without crashing or slowing down.
- The application should be able to run on macOS and Linux.
- The application should be able to handle multiple audio files concurrently.
- The application should be able to provide detailed error messages in case of failures.
- The application should be well-documented and easy to use.
- The application should follow Rust's best practices and idioms.
# the application should be well documented and easy to use and learn form
# the application should be able to handle various audio formats including WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, and OGG.
# The application should be able to transcribe audio files in real-time or from pre-recorded files.
